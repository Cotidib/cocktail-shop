# cocktail-shop
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Cocktails project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings

Main React functionalities I learned: search bar, use reducer and use context. I made my own setup, styling and added some extra features.

### Future development:
- notification modals
- filters
- lazy loading or infinite scrolling
